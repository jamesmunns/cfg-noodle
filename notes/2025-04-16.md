# Configuration File System

LSM-tree style key:value store, might be implemented on top of a classic filesystem?

There are two concepts:

* The **Path** of a piece of data, which is made up of three parts:
    * The "user prefix"
    * The "structural shape"
    * The "leaf type"
* The **Payload** of a data, which is ALWAYS a primitive of one of the following types:
    * `bool`
    * `u[8, 16, 32, 64, 128]`
    * `i[8, 16, 32, 64, 128]`
    * `f[32, 64]`
    * `str`
    * `[u8]`
    * `option<t>`, where `t` is one of the above items
    * `map<k, v>`, where `k` and `v` are both one of the above items
    * `[t]`, where `t` is one of the above items
    * `schema`, which encodes the schema of all items

TODO: enums?

For the **Path** segment, we use the notation:

```
PATH::STRUCTURAL:TYPE
```

For example, a user might have the following data:

```rust
struct UartPinmap {
    tx: Option<u8>,
    rx: Option<u8>,
    rts: Option<u8>,
    cts: Option<u8>,
}

struct UartConfig {
    baudrate: u32,
    silent_time_us: u16,
    pins: UartPinmap,
}
```

The could chose a "user prefix" of: `/config/uart`. When stored on disk, this would add the following
records:

* `/:::{folder}`
* `/config:::{folder}`
* `/config/uart:::{schema}`
* `/config/uart::baudrate:{u32}`
* `/config/uart::silent_time_us:{u16}`
* `/config/uart::pins.tx:{option<u8>}`
* `/config/uart::pins.rx:{option<u8>}`
* `/config/uart::pins.rts:{option<u8>}`
* `/config/uart::pins.cts:{option<u8>}`

This could be written by the user using an API like:

```rust
let cfg: UartConfig = ...;
storage.write::<UartConfig>("/config/uart", &cfg).await?;
```

This could be read by the user using an API like:

```rust
let cfg: UartConfig = storage.read_strict::<UartConfig>("/config/uart").await?;
```

## Storage on disk

We probably want some kind of appendable record format, to avoid rewriting whole blocks when we make small
changes. We could probably use something like cobs for this. This could be a single initial write to a block

```text
cobs {
    [0] => {
        tyname: "UartConfig",
        subschemas: [
            {
                tyname: UartPinmap,
                fields: [
                    "tx":option<u8>,
                    "rx":option<u8>,
                    "rts":option<u8>,
                    "cts":option<u8>,
                ]
            }
        ],
        fields: [
            "baudrate":u32,
            "silent_time_us":u16,
            "pins":ty => ss[0],
        ]
    },
    [1] => 19200,
    [2] => 2000,
    [3].ss[0].[0] => Some(10),
    [3].ss[0].[1] => Some(11),
    [3].ss[0].[2] => None,
    [3].ss[0].[2] => None,
} <CRC>
```

Note the tricky indexing stuff, this is to avoid two problems:

* rewriting field names multiple times, instead using some kind of "schema index" record
* avoid repeated schemas

If we then change baudrate from 19200 to 57600, we could add a second record like this

```text
cobs {
    // unchanged record from above
} <CRC>
cobs {
    [1] => 57600
} <CRC>
```

When writing, we just append to the file. This could be compacted at some point, erasing the previous history.

When reading, we need to start at the end of the file and work backwards, handling any schema changes that
occur over time. We could force users to "freshen up" the data when a schema changes.

## Schema changes

### Background

Over time, the schema may change. There are 2-3 kinds of changes that a schema may experience:

1. a REMOVAL of a field
2. an ADDITION of a field
3. a rename of a field

The first is generally easiest to handle: we ignore the removed field when retrieving data.

The second is a bit harder, and there are a couple ways to handle this in the event of a read:

* Deny the read completely, either returning a "not found" error or "no matching type found" error
* State that missing fields always need some "default", either by type (e.g. bool is always false), or
  schema annotations, like an additional attribute in the struct
* Maybe do BOTH, with `read_strict` and `read_default`
    * But then is it important to tell the difference between "was set, happened to be default", and
      "wasn't set, gave default"?
    * Protobuf has this problem
* Only allow default on some types, like `option<t>`?
    * can be annoying to have code that always has to deal with options for data that is "always" there

The third is the hardest, because it requires some guessing. Should we be able to detect this change?

```rust
// before
struct Example {
    temperature: f32
}

// after
struct Example {
    temperature_c: f32 // name change
}
```

what about this one?

```rust
// before
struct Example {
    temperature: f32
}

// after
struct Example {
    temperature: f64 // type change
}
```

what about this one?

```rust
// before
struct Example {
    temperature: f32
}

// after
struct Example {
    temperature_c: f64 // name and type change
}
```

what about this one?

```rust
// before
struct Example {
    a: u32,
    b: u32,
}

// after
struct Example {
    x: u32,
    y: u32,
}
```

### Concretely

Our current file looks like this:

```text
cobs {
    [0] => {
        tyname: "UartConfig",
        subschemas: [
            {
                tyname: UartPinmap,
                fields: [
                    "tx":option<u8>,
                    "rx":option<u8>,
                    "rts":option<u8>,
                    "cts":option<u8>,
                ]
            }
        ],
        fields: [
            "baudrate":u32,
            "silent_time_us":u16,
            "pins":ty => ss[0],
        ]
    },
    [1] => 19200,
    [2] => 2000,
    [3].ss[0].[0] => Some(10),
    [3].ss[0].[1] => Some(11),
    [3].ss[0].[2] => None,
    [3].ss[0].[2] => None,
} <CRC>
cobs {
    [1] => 57600
} <CRC>
```

We then update our schema as so:

```rust
// before
struct UartConfig {
    baudrate: u32,
    silent_time_us: u16,
    pins: UartPinmap,
}

// after
struct UartConfig {
    baudrate: u32,
    silent_time_us: u16,
    pins: UartPinmap,
    invert: bool, // new field
}
```

We have to choose whether we "update" the schema record on first access (read or write), or only on first write.

We'd want to probably write the whole new schema, whenever we do that. This could look as so:

```text
cobs {
    [0] => {
        tyname: "UartConfig",
        subschemas: [
            {
                tyname: UartPinmap,
                fields: [
                    "tx":option<u8>,
                    "rx":option<u8>,
                    "rts":option<u8>,
                    "cts":option<u8>,
                ]
            }
        ],
        fields: [
            "baudrate":u32,
            "silent_time_us":u16,
            "pins":ty => ss[0],
        ]
    },
    [1] => 19200,
    [2] => 2000,
    [3].ss[0].[0] => Some(10),
    [3].ss[0].[1] => Some(11),
    [3].ss[0].[2] => None,
    [3].ss[0].[2] => None,
} <CRC>
cobs {
    [1] => 57600
} <CRC>
cobs {
    [0] => {
        tyname: "UartConfig",
        subschemas: [
            {
                tyname: UartPinmap,
                fields: [
                    "tx":option<u8>,
                    "rx":option<u8>,
                    "rts":option<u8>,
                    "cts":option<u8>,
                ]
            }
        ],
        fields: [
            "baudrate":u32,
            "silent_time_us":u16,
            "pins":ty => ss[0],
            "invert":bool,
        ]
    },
} <CRC>
```

(maybe we can find a smart way to not rewrite the whole schema? idk)

Something to note is that we may not need to update the schema on read, the caller knows the current
schema they expect, we can "seed" the read with that if necessary.
